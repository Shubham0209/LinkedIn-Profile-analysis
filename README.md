# LinkedIn-Profile-analysis

If you are a LinkedIn user, have you ever wondered about the segments of people in your network? 

How about your messages? Are they mostly positive and about the topics that are related to your interests?

This repo contains the notebook in which I analysed my Linkedin connections (their job roles, companies they work in etc) and also the messages I received (i.e sentiment and frequently used words).

PS: You can get the respective csv files (Connections.csv and Messages.csv) related to your linkedin from Account-> Privacy and Settings->Get a copy of your data.
